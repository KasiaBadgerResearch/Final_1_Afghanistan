# Does urbanization drive changes in poverty in Afghanistan between 2006 and 2022?

## Abstract

Urbanization and poverty are closely linked in fragile contexts, yet their dynamics in Afghanistan remain understudied. This study examines changes in slum population (% of urban population) and national poverty headcount ratio between 2006 and 2022 using World Bank World Development Indicators. Both indicators increased over the period, with slum population showing a slight downturn in recent years while poverty headcount rose sharply and consistently. These descriptive trends suggest that urbanization pressures may be associated with poverty dynamics, though the results remain correlational. The findings highlight the need for additional indicators and regional data to better understand the complex interplay between urban growth and poverty reduction.

## 1. Question

Does urbanization drive changes in poverty in Afghanistan between 2006 and 2022?
- **Proxy for urbanization**: Slum population (% of urban population)
- **Measure of poverty**: Poverty headcount ratio (% of population)

## 2. Data

- **Source**: World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
- **Indicators**:
  - Population living in slums (% of urban population)
  - Poverty headcount ratio at national poverty lines (% of population)
- **Coverage**: Afghanistan, 2006–2022 (years with available data only)
- **Notes**: Only national-level data; some years missing for each indicator.

## 3. Method

1. Filtered dataset for Afghanistan.
2. **Selected relevant columns**: Year, Indicator Name, Value.
3. Pivoted indicators into separate columns and sorted by year.
4. Produced a line graph comparing slum population and poverty headcount over time.

(Analysis is descriptive; no causal methods were applied.)

## 4. Results

- **Urbanization** (slum population): Increased steadily until recent years, when a slight downturn is observed.
- **Poverty headcount**: Rose consistently, increasing more sharply than slum population.
- **Comparison**: Both indicators increased overall. The slowdown in slum growth contrasts with continued poverty increases, suggesting urban improvements did not reduce poverty.

## 5. Interpretation

- Rising slum population reflects ongoing urbanization pressures.
- Poverty growth outpaced urbanization improvements, indicating that urban expansion alone may not alleviate poverty.
- Descriptive trends highlight the complexity of development dynamics in Afghanistan and the limits of national-level indicators.

## 6. Limitations

- Only two indicators analyzed.
- Gaps exist for some years.
- National-level data only; no regional detail.
- No causal relationships established.

## 7. Next Steps / Extensions

- Incorporate additional urbanization and poverty indicators.
- Use subnational/regional data to study heterogeneity.
- Apply econometric models to test causal pathways.
- Compare Afghanistan with similar fragile states for broader insight.
